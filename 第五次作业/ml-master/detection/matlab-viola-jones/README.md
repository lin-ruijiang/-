# Viola-Jones Face Detection for Matlab
### A CSCi 5561 Spring 2015 Semester Project

Authors: Chee Yi Ong, Stephen Peyton

### Introduction

This is a slightly modified Viola-Jones face detection algorithm built using Matlab. Here's a quick rundown of the code flow:

* Preprocessing: variance normalization, gamma correction for ‘hard’ (under/over-exposed) images
* Train weak classifiers from Haar-like features
* Boost weak classifiers using Adaboost
* Face detection using a cascade structure

### Assumptions

 1. Frontal-facing images ONLY.
 2. Background is not cluttered. Solid-colored background works the best.
 3. Tilting of the head is at a minimum.
 4. Image size is approximately 300x400 or similar. Individual features are a minimum of 
  19x19, because that is the smallest size of a single Haar feature or classifier.
  5. One face-of-interest per image.

### Instructions

This folder contains two subfolders: `trainHaar` and `detectFaces`. `trainHaar` consists of the training algorithm which trains classifiers using Haar-like features, while `detectFaces` uses the trained classifiers to detect faces.

The `main` functions for both parts of the face detection routine are named identically to the folder containing the code, i.e., `trainHaar.m` for the training part, and `detectFaces.m` for the detection part.
 
 1. Training: simply start the training by running the script `trainHaar` on the command line. Note that this takes _approximately 21 hours_ on a 2.6GHz quad-core i7.
 2. Detection: `detectFaces('image.jpg')` or `detectFaces('someDirectory/image.jpg')`.

### Opportunities for improvements:
* Train algorithm with a larger set of images
* Better thresholding with more Adaboost training rounds
* Better cascade structuring with fewer, stronger classifiers: real-time detection possible
